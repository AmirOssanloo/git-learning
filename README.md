## Nothing Gold Can Stay

Nature's first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf's a flower;
But only so an hour.

## Secrets Under Trees

Tiny little secrets
Get buried in the dirt,
And if they were dug up,
Someone would probably get hurt,

## Someday

Someday you will cry for me
Like I cried for you.
Someday you'll miss me
Like I missed you.

## Be Proud Of Who You Are

I come with no wrapping or pretty pink bows.
I am who I am, from my head to my toes.
I tend to get loud when speaking my mind.
Even a little crazy some of the time.

## I Am Unique

I come with no wrapping or pretty pink bows.
I am who I am, from my head to my toes.
I tend to get loud when speaking my mind.
Even a little crazy some of the time.
